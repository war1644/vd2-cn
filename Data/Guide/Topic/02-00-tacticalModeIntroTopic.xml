<mainText attr1="Tactical Mode Overview:"/>
<mainText attr1="Tactical mode is where the RTS aspect of Void Destroyer is managed. Tactical mode is a 3D battle map, command interface and asset manager. Void Destroyer's tactical mode is heavily inspired by classic RTS games, both space and ground based. I tried to include commonly seen elements/interfaces of those classic games and tried to make the interface similar as well to create familiarity of use."/>

<mainText attr1="History/Concept:"/>
<mainText attr1="Void Destroyer originally was intended to be a space sim. Early in its development I got to the point of needing a to add a map. I created a 2D map that is commonly found in space sim and other games. I realized that one of the things that I didn't like about other space sims is their 2D map and decided to go the 3D route. RTS style interfaces excel at issuing orders to a single or multiple ships - another sore point of many space sims is often how difficult fleet management can be. The - issue commands - RTS style interface became apparent and Void Destroyer went on the hybrid path."/>
