<mainText attr1="Use: "/>
<mainText attr1="I grew up with games that required reading the manual (PC games), there were no tutorials and in the early days you had to have a joystick (which needed a dedicated card added to the PC), mouse support was a luxury that came later. Still the intent isn't that this manual is read from top to bottom, rather based on your interest and need when playing the game."/>
