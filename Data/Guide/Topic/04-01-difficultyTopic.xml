<mainText attr1="Due to player feedback I decided to include the option to lower the difficulty."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="Although my goal is that you never need or want to use this feature - I would rather that you lower the difficulty rather than quitting the game in frustration."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="There's two ways to control difficulty: "/>
<mainText attr1="Constant player ship damage reduction (can be toggled on/off at any point) and one time enemy ship health reduction (can be used as many times as you want)."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="Enemy health reduction buttons: "/>
<mainText attr1="In the - in game - menu clicking on the Difficulty button gives you the option to lower enemy ship health. This only affects ships within 2k distance of a friendly ship, doesn't persist across save files and isn't cumulative."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="If you so chose - you can get past a particularly sticky (or ill designed) spot and then continue."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="Consider avoiding this feature in the early game, because you might be missing a key component of the game that greatly increases survival (ship building, tactics, defensive platforms, command ship upgrades and abilities). Consider looking at the game guide - mission tips section. If that doesn't help - then using this feature could help you get past a particularly challenging (or ill designed) spot and thus continue to learn the game, making future challenges more manageable."/>

<mainText attr1="PLEASE NOTE: The story/mission structure of the game sometimes relies on overwhelming force to shepherd the player or signal that the player chose a non-intended course of action/path. Using these difficulty options may interfere with this."/>
