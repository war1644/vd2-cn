<mainText attr1="Behind the scenes:"/>
<mainText attr1="Deciding that ships should inherit postures and weapons hold settings is tricky. Overall I chose the inheritance route to make things simpler in terms of micro managing."/>
<mainText attr1="For example - a formation leader is set to do not engage, a new ship enters the sector via a gate and forms up with the leader (rally point setting). If not for inheritance the new ship might engage the enemy instead of taking the defensive posture of lead ship.  Without inheritance the player would have to select the new ship and then set the proper setting."/>
