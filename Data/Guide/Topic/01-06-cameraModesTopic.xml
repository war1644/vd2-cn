<mainText attr1="Camera Modes Overview:"/>
<mainText attr1="I've tried to include all possible camera modes, each one has its pros and cons."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="Cockpit mode: optimized for dogfights and firing fixed primary and secondary weapons."/>
<mainText attr1="Chase mode: optimized for dogfights, less precise forward view but increased situational awareness. Good for firing turrets."/>
<mainText attr1="Orbit mode: vanity mode - check out your ship. Good for picking up objects such as cargo pods."/>
<mainText attr1="Turret mode: control a single turret. Press the turret mode key again to cycle to the next turret. Manual control of a turret can be good at taking out large mines."/>
<mainText attr1="Command mode: optimized for capital ships, or ships with turrets. Good for targeting, and has a built in alternate mouse flight mode. Can issue single ship commands."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="Classic space sims tended to not include chase camera modes, this was seen mostly in more arcade shooters. Here however you are given as many choices as I could think off. None of the modes are locked out from use - for example you can use command mode in a fighter or cockpit mode in a cruiser - though if a ship doesn't have at least one turret then you can't use turret mode.

<mainText attr1="Ship weapons vary so the optimal camera mode can vary from ship to ship."/>
