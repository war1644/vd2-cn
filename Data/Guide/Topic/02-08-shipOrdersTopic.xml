<mainText attr1="Ship Orders Overview:"/>
<mainText attr1="Chances are - most of your ship orders will be done via right click. The above are some other orders you might use occasionally. As well as keyboard shortcuts - most have buttons as well (see image)."/>
<mainText attr1="If multiple ships are selected - they all get the same order (if applicable)."/>
<mainText attr1="In case of unwanted behavior - clear orders and targets (see image)"/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="Don't forget you can use - Time Dilation - PAUSE key (by default) during ship orders."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="Use and Notes:"/>
<mainText attr1="Issuing orders can get a bit complicated and unintended results can occur - some commands are - base commands - meaning that they override/clear other commands. A very simple/obvious example of this is - if issue a attack command, then a stop command, the attack command gets lost. Other more complex and unexpected cases exist."/>
<mainText attr1="Some of these commands are artifacts from the game's long development cycle. For example - the Idle command is nearly covered via the Do Not Engage setting. I decided to leave it in - because it was already in the game. The Patrol command is similar to this - and might be enhanced in the future."/>
<mainText attr1="The Turn command is useful in large ships - orient them for optimal turrets before the enemy arrives."/>
<mainText attr1="The Wait command is useful for engaging the enemy. Because different ships move at different speeds - you might want to issue a delay to better control the engagement. The Wait command gets placed on top of other commands - thus doesn't cancel any other order."/>
<mainText attr1="Most of the time - after completing a Move command - a Stop Here command is automatically issued."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="The Player Ship - commands and crew control:"/>
<mainText attr1="Issuing commands to the current player ship has a few complications - if crew control is turned off."/>
<mainText attr1="Right clicking on an object (for example an enemy ship) designates that a as a target."/>
<mainText attr1="However - if crew control is off the ship won't engage."/>
<mainText attr1="This is still useful for finding targets in tactical mode for use in ship mode."/>
<mainText attr1="If another command is issued (for example move, wait, turn)"/>
<mainText attr1="Crew control will be automatically enabled on the current player ship."/>
<mainText attr1="Just like in Ship Mode - you can toggle Crew Control on and off via the F6 key (by default)."/>
