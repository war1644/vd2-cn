<mainText attr1="Overview:"/>
<mainText attr1="Ships have a variety of weapon systems, some weapon systems can't be directly player controlled - for example automated missile turrets. Because there are some tiny stealth elements in the game, and because I could see this being useful in the future (potential mods where ships have limited ammo) I added this feature to further control ships."/>
