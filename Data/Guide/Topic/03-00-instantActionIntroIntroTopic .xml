<mainText attr1="Using:"/>
<mainText attr1="Instant Action mode is available from the main menu. You will then see unlocked Scenarios, and have access to the Arena and Skirmish buttons."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="Instant Action in Void Destroyer evolved from the Battle Editor - which evolved as way of me having a tool to set up the game's mission and at the same time give the same map builder for player use."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="As I was working on the game's missions - I realized that it would be great to be able to create one off scenarios that may or may not be related to the story. Giving unique challenges, or a different perspective, so Instant Action scenarios were added."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="Players then requested an Arena mode and Skirmish mode - an easier/quicker way to set up battles besides using the slower battle editor."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="Unlocking scenarios and objects:"/>
<mainText attr1="Because I don't want to spoil the game's story/missions - but I want players to have access to all the toys that are avaiable to play with - in game objects have to be unlocked. The main way of unlocking them is via playing the story/mission game mode. Furthermore instant action scenarios will unlock ships featured in them. You can then add them in arena/skirmish modes as well as the battle editor."/>
