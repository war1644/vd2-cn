<mainText attr1="History/Behind the scenes:"/>
<mainText attr1="Grouping ships was added to Void Destroyer (a very long time) before formations. Nearly every RTS has unit grouping, but not every RTS has formations (that concept doesn't always apply to certain genres) - or grouping is just used."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="Grouping and formations are fairly close to concept. Personally when I added formations to the game - I nearly stopped using groups. The two exist in Void Destroyer - so feel free to use one, the other, or both."/>
