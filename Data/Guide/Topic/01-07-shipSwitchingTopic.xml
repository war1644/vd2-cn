<mainText attr1="Ship Switching Overview:"/>
<mainText attr1="I've played a lot of games, space sims included - often I would see a ship piloted by friend or foe and want to pilot that ship. However space sims usually only let you pilot one ship per mission. There are space sims that let you change ships - but this tended to be a somewhat of an involved experience. So in making my own game - one of the goals was to make ship switching easy."/>

<mainText attr1="The idea behind ship switching is that enjoyment comes from options, that different ships are suited for different tasks, and that games are dynamic so situations arise that you might need to change to another ship."/>

<mainText attr1="Potential Reasons to switch ships:"/>
<mainText attr1="You might not want to risk a cruiser in an asteroid field, but risking drones is ok and you'll provide cover in one of them."/>
<mainText attr1="You might not send in your main fleet, but a wing of fighters to soften up defences is a path to victory - and you'll pilot a bomber. "/>
<mainText attr1="A large ship has particularly good turret coverage to deal with swarms of fighters or drones."/>
<mainText attr1="Maybe a cruiser is in trouble and needs to evade incoming ships."/>
<mainText attr1="Maybe you want to manually dock a marine frigate to a base - charging in using afterburners to evade enemy fire."/>

<mainText attr1="To accommodate ship switching - game mechanics:"/>
<mainText attr1="A fighter dying isn't the end of the game when you have the command ship."/>
<mainText attr1="Most ships can be re-built - ok to take risks"/>
<mainText attr1="Command ship health is displayed in the upper right hand corner, so you can easily track it."/>
<mainText attr1="You can track other ship's health via the watched objects GUIs."/>
<mainText attr1="You can slow down time to pick a ship to switch to or get a heads up on the tactical situation that might require a different ship."/>
<mainText attr1="A variety of ships exist - including a variety of primary and secondary weapons."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="Some strategy gamers might like to sit exclusively in a large ship - and that is a ok - but I hope those that for those that enjoy switching ships - Void Destroyer gives you opportunities."/>
