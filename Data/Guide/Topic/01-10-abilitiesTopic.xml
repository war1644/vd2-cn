<mainText attr1="Command Ship Abilities Concept/History:"/>
<mainText attr1="The command ship came about as a solution to a problem. I wanted ship switching, I wanted this to be done via remote control (so that destroyed ships didn't mean the end of the game - player death), I wanted some in game universe explanation for this ability."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="A command ship concept formed - a powerful ship that is capable of managing fleets, giving the player remote control ability and survivability - but not invulnerability (increased challenge and risk and reward). Because games tend to follow a usually increasing difficulty curve - and Void Destroyer isn't an exception - the command ship needed to be upgraded. Because passive upgrades tend to be fairly boring - active upgrades were introduced as well."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="Command Ship Abilities Philosophy:"/>
<mainText attr1="I don't like mandatory things and Void Destroyer is a hybrid game that hopes to cater go dogfight enthusiasts, strategy gamers and those wanting to pilot larger ships. This means that the game can be won without using command ship abilities - they are added as additional tools in the player arsenal."/>
<mainText attr1="These abilities are also created with the idea of synergy - for example - lay down a radiation field then thrust backwards out of its range."/>
<mainText attr1="Use a tractor beam to tow a enemy ship closer - then use the command ability to take it over."/>
<mainText attr1="Other synergies and uses are for you to discover."/>

<mainText attr1="Using Command Ship Abilities:"/>
<mainText attr1="Besides the hot key method. You can cycle abilities via the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys (default) then use the END key (default) to activate the ability."/>
<mainText attr1="Don't forget that in the midst of combat you can dilate time - giving you opportunity to target an enemy ship, activate an ability then switch targets. This works well for abilities like command - where hurting the enemy ship with weapons fire isn't wanted."/>

<mainText attr1="Command Ship Abilities Unlocking:"/>
<mainText attr1="Abilities are unlocked and gained via playing the story/mission portion of the game. Some are given to the player while others must - lets just call it purchased - (see tactical mode). Once unlocked they can be used in instant action mode."/>
