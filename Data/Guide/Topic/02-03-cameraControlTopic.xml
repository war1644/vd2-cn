<mainText attr1="Camera Control Overview:"/>
<mainText attr1="Tactical mode camera is very similar to ship mode manual thrusts - by default it is a WASD and QE type movement. Where W moves forward and S moves the camera backwards. In addition - by moving the mouse cursor to the edges of the screen you can move the camera across the map as well. Rotating the camera is done in the standard RTS method of holding down the right mouse button and then moving the mouse."/>

<mainText attr1="To zoom in and out - use the mouse wheel."/>

<mainText attr1="Camera Shortcuts"/>
<mainText attr1="Although the above is technically all you need to know to move around the tactical mode there are several camera shortcuts and tools."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="When an object is selected (left click on an object to select it), pressing the F key (by default) will toggle follow mode. When follow is toggled - the camera will travel to center around the object. When a followed object moves the camera moves with it."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="You don't have to select an object to toggle follow - you can simply put your mouse over it then press the F key (default). THis is sometimes called - soft selecting."/>
<mainText attr1=" "/>
<mainText attr1="Using the follow you can quickly move around the map."/>
