<descriptionText attr1="The Kind is a faction composed of Stubs."/>
<descriptionText attr1=" "/>
<descriptionText attr1="After the MU and Outsider wars, a fleet of Stub ships waiting for instructions that never came, decided to find a base instead of rotting in their ships. While this in itself is surprising, what's even more surprising is that a base was found and settled. A new faction was formed, calling itself the Kind."/>
<descriptionText attr1=" "/>
<descriptionText attr1="There are quite a lot of issues and questions with the above story. How could a Stub 'decide' anything beyond its orders? What are the odds of finding an abandoned base? Some form of help and guidance is assumed."/>
<descriptionText attr1=" "/>
<descriptionText attr1="Questions aside, there's even more problems with the Kind's existence, they refuse to submit to TSF authority making them a pirate group, cut off from lawful society their choices are limited to the illegal by default. Overall the TSF have adapted a 'wait and see' approach, speculating that the members of the Kind will simply die out."/>
<descriptionText attr1=" "/>
<descriptionText attr1="A strange thing in this world indeed, any Stub is welcome here, possibly the only place of its kind."/>
